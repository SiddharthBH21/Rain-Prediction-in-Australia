# Predicting Rain in Australia to help farmers plan their crop harvesting

This project aims to facilitate more efficient planning and decision-making in the agriculture sector, helping farmers make informed decisions on planting and harvesting crops and assisting government officials in developing policies to support the industry.

I built linear regression, KNN, decision tree, logistic regression, and support vector machine models to predict the amount of rainfall in Australia. The models are trained on historical rainfall data collected from various weather stations across the country.

The Decision Tree model achieved the highest accuracy at 83.05% and was determined to be best for further implementation.
